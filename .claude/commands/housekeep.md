# Housekeeping - Update Project Documentation

Follow the context management guidelines in `docs/context-management.md`.

## Tasks

1. **Update documentation** with the latest work that has been done
   - Keep updates brief and only add necessary information
   - Don't add redundant or verbose content

2. **Update `docs/project_state.md`** with:
   - Current project progress
   - Completed tasks (mark with ✅)
   - Remaining open work items
   - Any new issues discovered during the session

3. **Update `docs/architecture.md`** if:
   - New components were added
   - Data flow changed
   - New API endpoints were created

## Guidelines

- Be concise - documentation should be scannable
- Only document what changed, don't rewrite everything
- Use the existing format and style in each doc
- If nothing changed in a doc, don't modify it
