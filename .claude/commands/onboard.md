   - Learn which files to read/avoid
   - Note the context budget guidelines

2. **Read `docs/project_state.md`**
   - Current focus and status
   - Implementation progress (all phases)
   - Recent sessions and work completed
   - Current issues and debugging
   - Open work items and todos
   - Future enhancements

3. **Read `docs/architecture.md`**
   - System overview and data flows
   - Key components and services
   - API endpoints
   - Caching strategy
   - Output formats

## Output

After reading all three files, provide a brief summary:

"Ready to go Abhi." 

Keep the summary concise and scannable. Focus on actionable information.

## Guidelines
